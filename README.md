# GGRobowars
- The sumobot will be using an ESP32 S3 WROOM which runs on the risc-v architecture
- It is to note that the relevant past code are all operated on an Atmega328 microcontroller, so it is best if prior research is done to check if the same code can be used on both
- All code for each component will be done baremetal, meading without using arduino functions as the microcontroller is not an STM32
